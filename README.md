GOT a age specific death rate of United States and Uganda in 2019

OBJECTIVE:
find the crude death rate of both the countries
find the age-standardized death rate of both the countries

ASSUMPTIONS:
assume that the age-specific death rates provided are accurate and representative of the entire population.
Additionally, I assume that the WHO standard population is appropriate for age-standardization.

DATA COLLECTION:
I retrieved the age-specific death rates of COPD from the web page for both the United States and Uganda for 2019. 
This data will be used to calculate both crude and age-standardized death rates.

CRUDE DEATH RATE CALCULATION:
The crude death rate is calculated by dividing the total number of deaths by the total population and 
then multiplying by 100,000 to express it per 100,000 people. For  both countries, I will sum up all age-specific death rates to
obtain the total deaths, and then divide by the total population.

AGE-STANDARDIZED DEATH RATE CALCULATION:
Age-standardized death rates allow for a fair comparison between populations with different age structures. To calculate this, I will use the WHO
standard population. First, I'll apply the age-specific death rates of each country to the WHO standard population to get the
expected number of deaths. Then, I'll divide the total expected deaths by the standard population and multiply by 100,000 to get
the age-standardized death rate.
